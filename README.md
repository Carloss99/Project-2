For this project i decided to create an inventory tracking app. This app is specifically holds accessories for a closet company just because thats i currently work at a closet company and deal with inventory tracking. Upon opening the website, the user will be taken to the main page where all the invetory accessories are displayed. The user will be able to navigate through the nav-bar to get to more specific accessories such as hooks, handles, or knobs. The user will also be able to click on the accessory name and will be taken to a page where more details are displayed for that item and is able to edit or delete it. The user can add a new accessory by clicking a button at the bottom of the page and filling out a form. After completeing this project i got a better understanding of the REST and CRUD concepts, but i feel i only lack in creativity. I defenitly need to a lot more research to get more ideas to be unique and creative.
